The <a href="./../references/resource-oriented-design.html">Resource-oriented design</a> pattern is widely adopted and provides detailed guidelines on how to approach the definitions and best practices for writing APIs.</p><h4 id="\u{1F468}\u200D\u{1F4BB}-user-actions-1" tabindex="-1">\u{1F468}\u200D\u{1F4BB} User actions <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F468}\u200D\u{1F4BB}-user-actions-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>The user is required to flesh out the proto, which should be consistent with <a href="https://google.aip.dev/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google&#39;s API Improvement Proposals</a>. Various tooling, such as linters, exists to aid this process.</p><p>The primary questions that developers aim to answer during this step is:</p><ol><li>What are the resources that we are considering?<br> These will be translated into the <code>messages</code> in the proto.<br><em>e.g. In the asset management space this may be a <code>porfolio</code> and <code>holdings</code>.</em></li><li>What are the potential relationships and hierarchy between the resources?<br><em>e.g. <code>portfolio</code> is the parent of <code>holdings</code>.</em></li><li>What operations are to be performed?<br> These will be translated into the <code>methods</code> of the proto, housed in a <code>service</code>.<br><em>e.g. <a href="https://google.aip.dev/131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Standard methods</a> such as <code>CreatePortfolio</code>, <code>UpdatePortfolio</code> or <a href="https://google.aip.dev/136" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">custom methods</a> such as <code>CheckPortfolioCompliance</code>.</em></li></ol><p>Since the protos sit within a version control repo, multiple developers may collaborate and iterate on the proto design.

It communicates that the current state of the proto is the source of truth. In other words, it is what should be implemented on your side and what clients can expect to consume. There is a lot that also happens in the background which we will unpack in the following section.</p><h4 id="\u{1F468}\u200D\u{1F4BB}-user-actions-2" tabindex="-1">\u{1F468}\u200D\u{1F4BB} User actions <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F468}\u200D\u{1F4BB}-user-actions-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>Simply run the <code>alis proto release</code> command from the terminal.</p><h4 id="\u{1F3D7}-alis-build-1" tabindex="-1">\u{1F3D7} Alis Build <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F3D7}-alis-build-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>The release of the proto automatically kicks off a lot of processes on Alis Build platform, which include:</p><ul><li>Auto-generating internal and client facing client libraries for a range of supported languages (currently Go, Python and JavaScript). This allows for easy implementation of the methods and allows clients to easily consume your services in their own development environment.</li><li>Autoconfiguring API gateways for the services specified in the protos. This provides HTTP endpoints for the gRPC methods, allowing for traditional REST calls to be made to the endpoints.</li><li><a href="./../how-to-guides/auto-generated-docs.html">Auto-generating documentation</a> for your product directly from your proto definitions.</li></ul><p>This single source of truth also sets the foundation for additional auto-generated aspects, which are discussed in the following sections.</p><h2 id="implement-create-neuron" tabindex="-1">Implement: Create neuron <a class="header-anchor" href="#implement-create-neuron" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>A neuron is a <em>unit of compute</em> within a product, i.e. the infrastructure and code that executes the logic. This therefore consists of a set of cloud infrastructure and, in most cases, some form of code implementation. The cloud infrastructure is specified using Terraform and the code implementation may be done in any language.</p><h4 id="\u{1F468}\u200D\u{1F4BB}-user-actions-3" tabindex="-1">\u{1F468}\u200D\u{1F4BB} User actions <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F468}\u200D\u{1F4BB}-user-actions-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>Simply run the <code>alis neuron create</code> command from the terminal and follow the prompts.</p><h4 id="\u{1F3D7}-alis-build-2" tabindex="-1">\u{1F3D7} Alis Build <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F3D7}-alis-build-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>In the background, the platform will provide pre-populated Terraform files based on the neuron requirements. Furthermore, code template files are also available which use a templating engine along with the latest protocol buffer release to auto-generate server implementation code in the supported languages.</p><h2 id="implement-specify-infrastructure" tabindex="-1">Implement: Specify infrastructure <a class="header-anchor" href="#implement-specify-infrastructure" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The Terraform files define the required infrastructure needs that will be applied in the respective cloud environments.</p><h4 id="\u{1F468}\u200D\u{1F4BB}-user-actions-4" tabindex="-1">\u{1F468}\u200D\u{1F4BB} User actions <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F468}\u200D\u{1F4BB}-user-actions-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>When creating the neuron, the platform provides a set of Terraform files. These can either be customised or additional specifications may be added based on the needs of your implementation. The <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">documentation on the Terraform site</a> serves as an excellent reference for this.</p><h4 id="\u{1F3D7}-alis-build-3" tabindex="-1">\u{1F3D7} Alis Build <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F3D7}-alis-build-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>The Alis CLI has the command available <code>alis gen terraform</code> which is able to generate commonly used Terraform specs out of the box.</p><h2 id="implement-business-logic" tabindex="-1">Implement: Business logic <a class="header-anchor" href="#implement-business-logic" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>In the majority of cases, there is some form of code implementation which realises the methods defined in protocol buffer, referred to as the implementation of the server.
