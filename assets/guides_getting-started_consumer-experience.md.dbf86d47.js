Whether you are getting results from a model, updating a database or executing trades, all of these actions should feel familiar. This allows you to seamlessly adopt anything across the platform without spending hours in obscure documentation and the toil of attempting to integrate it in your code.</p><p>What does that experience feel like? In this section, we want to provide you with a few basic concepts and then allow you to experience the Alis Build platform for yourself. Below is a teaser of what you can expect \u{1F609}.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p><img src="'+p+`" alt=""></p><h2 id="definition-first-approach" tabindex="-1">Definition-first approach <a class="header-anchor" href="#definition-first-approach" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The Alis Build platform leverages a core set of open-source technologies, all certified by the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>. An essential part of how we make the platform work is the strict adoption of <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Protocol Buffers</a>, also referred to as <em>Protobufs</em>.</p><p>From a technical perspective:</p><blockquote><p>Protocol buffers are a language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Source</a></p></blockquote><p>What is important from a practical perspective however is that:</p><blockquote><p>You <strong>define how you want your data to be structured once</strong>, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages. <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Source</a></p></blockquote><p>Two things to take note of:</p><ol><li>Defining things is the first, essential part of building on the Alis Build platform. Everything that you will be working with (<em>resources</em>) and what you will be doing (<em>services</em>) is defined once in a <code>.proto</code> file.</li><li>The definitions of these resources and services are then used to generate source code in the language of your choice to implement, or work with, the resources and services you defined.</li></ol><p>Find out more about Protobufs, their usage and benefits on the platform in the <a href="/guides/references/core-technologies.html">core technologies article</a>.</p><h2 id="experience-the-simplicity" tabindex="-1">Experience the simplicity <a class="header-anchor" href="#experience-the-simplicity" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><h3 id="books-proto" tabindex="-1">Books.proto <a class="header-anchor" href="#books-proto" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Let us consider a <code>Book</code> resource with <em>name</em>, <em>display name</em>, <em>authors</em> and <em>publishers</em> as fields. This is defined in a <code>books.proto</code> file as follows:</p><div class="language-"><button class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre><code>// The definition of a book resource.

	// The name of the book.

	string name = 1 [(google.api.field_behavior) = OUTPUT_ONLY];

	// The display name of the book.
	string display_name = 2 [(google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED];

	// The authors of the book.
	repeated string authors = 3 [(google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED];

	// The publisher of the book
	string publisher = 4 [(google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED];
}
</code></pre></div><p>The builders of this product allows you to list all the books available, <code>ListBooks</code>, and to retrieve the details of a specific book, <code>GetBook</code>. These are also defined in the <code>books.proto</code> file as part of the <code>BooksService</code>:</p><div class="language-"><button class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre><code>// Book service for foo.br.
service BooksService {
	// List all available books.

	}
	// Get a specific book.
	rpc GetBook(GetBookRequest) returns (Book) {
