curl https://files.cli.alis.services/linux/amd64/latest/alis --output $HOME/alis.build/cli/alis
```
  
4. Place the file in your _alis.build/cli_ folder. Run the following command to give it execute permission:

```bash
chmod a+x $HOME/alis.build/cli/alis
```

5. Close and restart all currently open terminal windows, including IDEs, such that the configurations of the paths can take place.

::: warning **Unidentified developer error?**
For macOS, open the CLI by right-clicking on the file and open. This will prompt you _The application is from an unidentified developer. Are you sure you want to open it?_.

Select open. This will allow macOS permission to always run the CLI, and therefore you only have to do it with your initial installation.
